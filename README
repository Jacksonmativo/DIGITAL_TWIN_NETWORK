## 🧠 Network Behavior Modeling for AI Security

A core objective of this project is to **twin real and simulated networks** in order to generate high-quality behavioral data for **training AI models to detect malicious and anomalous network activity**.

Instead of inspecting packet payloads, the system focuses on **traffic behavior and metadata**, which is safer, scalable, and aligned with modern defensive security practices.

### 🔹 Normal Network Behavior (Baseline)

The Digital Twin learns and models what *healthy* network traffic looks like, including:

- **Packet rate** – Average and peak packets per second
- **Protocol distribution** – Typical ratios of TCP / UDP / ICMP traffic
- **Session duration** – Normal connection lifetimes
- **Latency & jitter** – Expected response times and variation
- **Retry patterns** – Normal retransmission behavior
- **DNS request frequency** – Standard domain resolution patterns
- **TLS handshake behavior** – Legitimate encrypted session setup characteristics

These metrics form the **baseline profile** used by the AI model.

### 🔹 Abnormal / Suspicious Network Behavior

The system also models and simulates deviations from the baseline, which may indicate malicious or misconfigured activity:

- **Sudden traffic spikes** – Abnormal surges in packet rate
- **Unusual protocol mix** – Unexpected protocol ratios
- **Repeated failed connections** – Authentication or connection failures
- **High entropy payload sizes** – Indicators of obfuscation or tunneling
- **Timing anomalies** – Irregular or unnatural traffic intervals
- **Connection floods** – Excessive simultaneous connections
- **Beacon-like periodic traffic** – Repeated, timed outbound signals

These behaviors are used to **label events**, **train anomaly-detection models**, and **evaluate AI predictions**.

### 🧪 Why Digital Network Twins Matter

By using Digital Network Twins, the project enables:

- Safe and controlled simulation of abnormal traffic
- Accurate labeling of normal vs suspicious behavior
- Repeatable experiments for AI training and evaluation
- Continuous retraining as network conditions evolve

This approach supports **behavior-based threat detection**, which is more resilient than traditional signature-based systems.
